# REAL-TIME CHAT WITH WEBSOCKET

The platform supports both individual and group chats, allowing users to communicate seamlessly. It includes features like chat color customization and the ability to manage group members effectively.
Users can log in to view active members, track unseen messages, and personalize their profiles by uploading avatars, ensuring a more engaging and tailored experience.

While the code may not be perfect and may still contain bugs, the goal is to provide a practical, hands-on experience in building a real-world application. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome.
